Starting with version 13, Angular caches build files in a cache folder under the .angular folder. These files don't impact much ... except in some cases when trying to search your files with VS Code.

Let's look at how we can ignore the files in the cache folder (or any folder) when using the VS Code search feature.

Angular cache files and VS Code search
I use VS Code for
most of my editing especially when
building angular applications
starting with version 13 angular caches
build files in a cache folder under the
.angular folder
 you can see the
gazillion of these cache files here
these files don't impact much except in
some cases when trying to search with VS Code 
I'll close this folder and open the
search window then search for
console.log
my look at all of these results in
the cache build files if I scroll all
the way down I finally see the one place
I'm actually using console.log in my
code not nice at all let's look
at how we can 
ignore the files in the
cache folder or any folder when
using VS Code

there are several options for how to
ignore or exclude files and folders when
searching 

Exclude folders using the Search window
one option is to 
click the ...

here then we can type in the
folders or 
files to exclude 

I'll type
**/.angular

 to
mean exclude all .angular subfolders
under the current project folder
that's much better now we see only the
one place that 
console.log 
appears in
the code 
if we close and reopen the
search our selection stays for this
project 
but if we would open another
angular project we'd lose our selection
so while this option works we'll have to
reset it for every project

I'll delete the entry in the files to
exclude text box as expected we again
see the build cache files in our search

Exclude folders from Search with User settings
let's instead use the VS Code user
settings to always exclude folders or
files for the current user that's us

click the manage icon and 
select
settings
then search for exclude

scroll down to 
Search: Exclude

let's add a pattern
we want to exclude 
**/.angular

click ok to save
going back to our search window I'll
click on the search text box and press
enter to re-execute our search
and it shows our one place that we use
console.log 
correctly excluding the
cached files nice

now we have a way to exclude these files
in all of our projects
notice that if we click on explore we
still see the 
.angular folder here

can we exclude the cache files from here
as well yes we can

to try it 

let's remove the setting we
just added I'll click on the pattern and
click the X to remove it
going back to the search window and
pressing enter to re-execute the search
we again see the cached files in our
search results

Exclude folders from Explorer with User settings

now let's exclude folders and files from
Explorer in the settings window scroll
up to 
Files: Exclude 

we'll add our
pattern here
click add pattern type in the pattern
for the folders or files to exclude
* */.angular 

and
click ok
click on explore and we no longer see
the .angular folder
going back to the search window I'll
press enter to re-execute the search and
notice that it excludes the files not
only from Explorer but also from the
search sweet

but let's try one more thing we'll start
by removing the setting we just added
in the 
settings window 
I'll click on the
pattern and click the X to remove it in
the search window 
I'll press enter and
we again see all of the extra files



Exclude folders from Search using .gitignore
now we're ready for one last option open
Explorer and click on 
.gitignore 
to open
it
this file defines the list of folders
and files that should be excluded when
checking the project in to get a version
control system this file is created by
the angular CLI
note that if you created your project
without the angular CLI you may not have
this file

scrolling down under the miscellaneous
section notice that it already excludes
the angular build cache files wouldn't
it be nice if we could just tell VS Code
to use this file during search
search could then ignore the same files
that we ignore when working with git

close this file 
open the search window
and go back to settings
search for ignore
here we see the option search use ignore
files you may already have this option
checked as it is on by default
I have mine on
wait what if this is on why isn't the
search ignoring our .angular build
files it should be ignoring all of the
folders and files listed on our .git
ignore file
it turns out that as of this recording
there's a bug in VS Code that prevents
this feature from working if there is
no .git folder in the project folder in
this project I'm working with there is
no .git folder so this feature doesn't
work
see the video notes for a link to the VS Code issue for this bug
so although this is the easiest way to
exclude gitignore folder and files from
search and as on by default it's not
currently working if you have no .git
folder for the project

Wrap Up
we covered several options that do
currently work
use the ...to exclude a folder
or set of files as needed
use the user settings files exclude
feature to exclude the files from the
project which also excludes them from
the search
or use the user settings search exclude
feature to exclude specific files and
folders when searching
I'll select this one and enter our
pattern again
**/.angular

now my search is much more
user friendly
I want to thank my Twitter friends
for help in finding these useful VS Code
features
